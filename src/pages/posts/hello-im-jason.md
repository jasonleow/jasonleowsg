I believe in ways of working and living that makes us more complete in our humanity. I aspire to create beautiful, thoughtful work using ways that are as efficient as they are people-centred; between the beautiful intricacies of the human soul, and the practical reality of economic efficiency. I cherish that I am able to bring my whole person – identity, personality, talents, interests – into my work. I love to work and enjoy working as a daily ritual of self growth.
