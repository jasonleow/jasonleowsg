> In a world where “job descriptions are self-descriptions”, I’m increasingly finding it hard to answer that frequent cocktail question, “So what do you do?” – Timothy Ferriss, The Four Hour Work Week

Couldn’t agree more with Tim on that. There’s so much I’d like to do, and so many widely-differing issues I’m concerned about, that ONE job description seems to no longer be enough. It feels like we’re moving into a future where we can earn a living by being[free agents](http://www.amazon.com/Free-Agent-Nation-Working-Yourself/dp/0446678791 "Free Agent Nation by Daniel Pink"), creating value in whatever we are interested to do, wherever we are. I’d much rather turn the phrase on its head: “self-descriptions as job descriptions”. This blog is my attempt at that.
