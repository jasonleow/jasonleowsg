I just learned a great new question today.

> “What do you imagine that moment will look like when you feel like everything is going to turn out okay?”

Add “in 2015” after “…everything…” and it turns into a better way to frame new year resolutions:

*“What do you imagine that moment will look like when you feel like everything in 2015 is going to turn out okay?”*
