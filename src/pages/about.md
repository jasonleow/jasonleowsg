Jason’s first forays in design was helping businesses build online brands through user-centered web design, where he applied design thinking to his freelance work. Before starting out in as a designer, he was previously with the [National Council of Social Service](http://www.ncss.gov.sg/ "National Council of Social Service") where he championed ground-up collaboration efforts between social services, voluntary welfare organisations and the grassroots.

At [The Human Experience Lab](http://www.challenge.gov.sg/print/feature/the-he%28art%29-of-designing-policies "The He(Art) Of Designing Policies | Challenge magazine") in the [Public Service Division](http://www.psd.gov.sg/ "Public Service Diviion, Prime Minister's Office"), Jason had the opportunity to bring his passions for human-centered design, social innovation and entrepreneurship into government to create public good. He spent 2 months at the globally renowned innovation firm [IDEO](http://www.ideo.com/ "IDEO"), working on a collaborative project commissioned by the housing authorities and PSD to look into the future of public housing. He had also worked on various multi-agency projects exploring issues such as Singaporeans’ career aspirations and helping persons with disabilities find employment.

He is now running [Outsprint](http://outsprint.io/ "Design sprints for public good & social impact."), a social enterprise as public innovation design consultancy, creating products and services that deliver public and social good. He recently helped [SG Enable](https://www.sgenable.sg/ "SG Enable"), an agency dedicated to enabling persons with disability, design a new grant experience through a one-week design sprint.

His pet passion of hoarding online articles had now found some popularity and practical use, in the [Design For Public Good Flipboard magazine](http://flip.it/CAG40 "Design For Public Good Flipboard magazine"), with over 12,000 readers.
